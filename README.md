# TECHMANIA Converter
A tool to convert .bms and .pt (work in progress) to .tech (TECHMANIA's format).

Code in [TechmaniaConverter/TechmaniaConverter/DJMax](https://github.com/macmillan333/techmania-converter/tree/main/TechmaniaConverter/TechmaniaConverter/DJMax) are reused from [DJMax-Editor](https://github.com/hsreina/DJMax-Editor) to load and parse .pt files. DJMax-Editor is originally released under the Apache License 2.0. Among these files, PtLoader.cs is extracted from [PTOpenFile.cs](https://github.com/hsreina/DJMax-Editor/blob/master/DJMaxEditor/Files/pt/PTOpenFile.cs), had the logging code removed, and output type changed. Other files are not modified.
